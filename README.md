# Ray Tracer

## Description

A ray tracer in Rust following the Phong reflection model, with renders stored in .ppm files.

## Installation

`cargo build`

## Testing

`cargo test`

## How to use

`cargo run`

In order to view the resulting render, you must have a way of opening .ppm files. On MacOS, ppm files can be opened directly. On other operating systems, you can install software to view it, like GIMP. If you don't want to install anything, try going to https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html to view the file.
